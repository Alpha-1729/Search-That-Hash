# HashSearch
ðŸ”ŽSearches Hash APIs and Google to crack your hash quicklyðŸ”Ž

More of a project to aid Ciphey than a project in of itself.

Work in progress. Not released yet!

# ToDo
- [x] Use HashID to find possible hashes and mode of hash
- [x] Add config file
- [x] Add argument parsing
- [x] Use only APIs that match these possible hashes
- [x] Add functions of providers
- [x] Multi thread the search calls
- [ ] Design README
- [ ] Build more documentation
- [x] https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-threadpoolexecutor-in-python-3
- [ ] Add config file so users can input their API keys (if they need them)
- [ ] Include Google search parsing (parse HASH:plaintext)
- [ ] If popular hash in set, do that one first
- [ ] Call Hashcat (Default with mode) or John with the mode.

# MVP 1
Import config file as dict
Pass dict to search_and_crack
search for hashes
