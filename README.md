ðŸ”ŽSearches Hash APIs and Google to crack your hash quicklyðŸ”Ž

More of a project to aid Ciphey than a project in of itself.

Work in progress. Not released yet!

# ToDo
* Use HashID to find possible hashes and mode of hash
* Use only APIs that match these possible hashes

* Call Hashcat (Default with mode) or John with the mode.
