# HashSearch
ðŸ”ŽSearches Hash APIs and Google to crack your hash quicklyðŸ”Ž

More of a project to aid Ciphey than a project in of itself.

Work in progress. Not released yet!

# ToDo
- [x] Use HashID to find possible hashes and mode of hash
- [x] Add config file
- [x] Add argument parsing
* Use only APIs that match these possible hashes
* Add functions of providers
* Add config file so users can input their API keys (if they need them)
* Include Google search parsing (parse HASH:plaintext)
* If popular hash in set, do that one first
* Call Hashcat (Default with mode) or John with the mode.
