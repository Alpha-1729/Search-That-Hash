# HashSearch
ðŸ”ŽSearches Hash APIs and Google to crack your hash quicklyðŸ”Ž

1. Searches Google & Hash APIs
2. If not found, detects type and cracks with John the Ripper or HashCat

Don't spend time cracking simple hashes which are found via APIs. Only crack the ones that aren't found!

If your hash is not found via Google or APIs, it will automatically detect the type and crack it.

# Features
* API first. Built for Ciphey, easy to use API.
* Use your own API keys or use free API services.
* Google search for single hashes.
* Automatic identification of hashes.
* Pipes into John / HashCat if hashes are not found in APIs.
* Caching technology. Have the same hash twice in the file? You won't need to crack it twice.
* Multi threaded, of course.

More of a project to aid Ciphey than a project in of itself.
